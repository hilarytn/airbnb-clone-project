# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application inspired by the core features and workflows of Airbnb. It is designed as a real-world simulation to help developers gain hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and collaborative web platforms. This project is part of a larger learning objective focused on mastering backend development, API security, CI/CD integration, and effective team collaboration.

## Project Goals

- Build a fully functional booking platform clone with Django and MySQL.
- Model real-world data through relational database design.
- Develop and secure RESTful or GraphQL APIs.
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub and best practices in version control.
- Automate deployment using modern CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions and Docker.
- Learn to document and plan complex software systems.

## 👥 Team Roles

The success of this project depends on a collaborative team, each contributing distinct skills and responsibilities. Below are the key roles and their contributions to the Airbnb Clone Project:

### 🔧 Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic, APIs, and core functionality using Django. Ensures business logic aligns with user workflows and integrates smoothly with the database and frontend.

### 🗄️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the relational database schema using MySQL. Handles data modeling, relationships, indexing, backup procedures, and ensures data integrity and performance.

### 🔐 Security Engineer
Implements security protocols to safeguard APIs and user data. Responsibilities include securing endpoints, handling authentication (e.g., token-based systems), authorization, and mitigating common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

### 🚢 DevOps Engineer
Sets up and maintains the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker. Responsible for automating deployment, monitoring build health, and ensuring that code changes flow seamlessly from development to production.

### 🧪 QA Engineer / Tester
Writes and executes test plans to ensure features function as intended. Performs unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Validates performance, usability, and security aspects of the application.


## 🧰 Technology Stack

Below is an overview of the core technologies used in the Airbnb Clone Project, along with their specific roles in building a scalable and secure web application.

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the server-side logic of the application. Django enables rapid development of RESTful APIs, supports authentication, and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.

### 🐬 MySQL
A relational database management system used to store and manage structured data for the platform, such as user accounts, property listings, bookings, and reviews. It supports ACID compliance, indexing, and complex relational queries.

### 🔗 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. It improves performance and flexibility over REST by enabling nested queries and real-time data fetching.

### 🐳 Docker
A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into isolated environments. It ensures consistent development and deployment across different machines and cloud providers.

### 🔄 GitHub Actions
A CI/CD automation tool that runs tests, lints code, and deploys changes automatically whenever updates are pushed to the repository. It streamlines the development workflow and reduces human error during deployment.

### 🛠️ Git & GitHub
Version control and code collaboration tools used to manage changes to the project, coordinate team development, and maintain transparency throughout the software lifecycle.

### 📦 Postman
An API client tool used to test API endpoints, validate response data, and simulate client-server interactions during development and debugging.

### 🐚 Markdown
A lightweight markup language used for writing project documentation, including the `README.md`, setup guides, and API docs in a human-readable format.

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project consists of several core features that replicate the functionality of a real-world booking platform. Each feature contributes to delivering a seamless experience for both guests and hosts.

### 👤 User Management
This feature handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile management. It allows users to sign up as either a host or a guest, with secure access to their personalized dashboard and activity history.

### 🏡 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details such as location, description, price, and images, enabling hosts to showcase their offerings and attract bookings.

### 📅 Booking System
Guests can search for available properties based on date, location, and price, then make bookings. This system manages availability checks, prevents double bookings, and tracks reservation history for both hosts and guests.

### 💳 Payment Integration
Secure payment functionality is integrated to handle booking transactions. Guests can pay using different methods, and hosts receive payouts, ensuring a smooth financial workflow.

### ✍️ Review & Rating System
After a booking is completed, guests can rate and review the property. Reviews help maintain quality and trust on the platform and allow future guests to make informed decisions.

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
Robust authentication using JWT and role-based access control ensures secure login and restricts access based on user roles (e.g., only hosts can manage listings).

### 🌐 Search & Filtering
Users can search for listings by city, date, price range, and amenities. This enhances discoverability and improves the user experience for guests looking for specific accommodations.


## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical component of any web application, especially one handling sensitive user data and financial transactions like the Airbnb Clone. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented to ensure the protection and integrity of the platform.

### 🔑 Authentication
We will implement secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This ensures that only registered users can access protected routes and functionalities. Authentication helps prevent unauthorized access and secures user sessions.

**Why it matters:** Protects user accounts and prevents impersonation or unauthorized actions within the application.

---

### 🛡️ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to determine what actions each user type (guest, host, admin) can perform. For example, only hosts can manage properties, and only guests can make bookings.

**Why it matters:** Prevents privilege escalation and ensures users can only access features relevant to their roles.

---

### 🚫 Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, rate limiting will be applied to the API endpoints. This limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given period.

**Why it matters:** Mitigates the risk of brute-force attacks, spamming, and system overload.

---

### 🔐 Data Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). This ensures that only safe and expected data enters the system.

**Why it matters:** Prevents common vulnerabilities that could compromise the database and user information.

---

### 🧾 Secure Payments
Payment transactions will be securely handled using encrypted communication (e.g., HTTPS) and integration with trusted third-party gateways (like Stripe or PayPal).

**Why it matters:** Ensures financial data is transmitted safely, protecting both the platform and its users from fraud.

---

### 📄 HTTPS Enforcement
All traffic between clients and the server will be encrypted via HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates.

**Why it matters:** Protects data in transit from being intercepted or tampered with by attackers.
