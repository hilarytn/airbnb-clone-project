# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application inspired by the core features and workflows of Airbnb. It is designed as a real-world simulation to help developers gain hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and collaborative web platforms. This project is part of a larger learning objective focused on mastering backend development, API security, CI/CD integration, and effective team collaboration.

## Project Goals

- Build a fully functional booking platform clone with Django and MySQL.
- Model real-world data through relational database design.
- Develop and secure RESTful or GraphQL APIs.
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub and best practices in version control.
- Automate deployment using modern CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions and Docker.
- Learn to document and plan complex software systems.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **API**: Django REST Framework or GraphQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Other Tools**: Markdown for documentation, Postman for API testing
